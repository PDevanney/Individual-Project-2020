* Dr. Jessica Enright

Week-by-week plan for the whole project. Update this as you go along.

## Winter semester

* **Week 1**
  * Rank Project Proposals
* **Week 2**
  * Meet supervisor for initial meeting
  * Initial Research, Develop Ideas
  * Set up Technology -- PyCharm, NetworkX, Anaconda, GitHub
  * Have programming at basic stage
    * Create Random Graph
    * Populates with set number of Towers at random vertices
    * Populates a Target at a Random vertex
      * Map Distance to Target from Graph
    * Display Graph
* **Week 3**
  * Refine Ideas with Supervisor
  * Do Additional Research as Required
  * Improve current codebase
  * Implement Turn feature (random or chosen moves by Target)
  * Begin to implement optimisations for Tower
* **Week 4**
  * Research additional optimisations that could be made
    * Gather evidence on why they will improve the code
  * Continue with optimisations
    * For Tower and Target
  * Edit:
    * Create GitHub Action for Automated Testing and Dissertation Build
    * Began to implement Testing
    * Implemented an Optimised Search Function -- Account previously visited node

* **Week 5**
  * Once optimisations are completed, begin to assess different Aspects
    * Effect of Optimisations on different graphs
    * Are optimisations valid?
      * Non-optimised vs Optimised
  * Edit:
    * Began work on the Optimal Path method
      * Researched possible algorithms to use - A* Combinatorial Search
    * Worked on Unit Tests for the code

* **Week 6**
  * Begin research into other Graph Types?
  * Start to complete an evaluation of the program on different settings - Number of Towers. Size of Graph, others...
  * Edit:
    * Began work on the Optimal Path method
      * Outputs the Tree of all paths in a Graph
* **Week 7**
  * Continue evaluation into different settings.
  * Edit:
    * Began Implementation of the Driver function.
    * Created workflows of the project.
* **Week 8**
  * With this knowledge look into improving the current codebase
  * Edit:
    * Improved Current codebase - added Search Driver method
    * Explored options of adapting the distance methods
* **Week 9**
  * Continue to refine codebase and operations
  * Edit:
    * No progress was made this week due to Coursework contributions
* **Week 10**
  * Begin to look into additional Graph Types that could be evaluated
  * Edit:
    * Completed Optimal Tower positioning function.
    * Created required test cases.
    * Improved current codebase.
* **Week 11 [PROJECT WEEK]**
  * Evaluation of different Graph types.
    * Easiest / Hardest to Locate Target
    * Can you always locate the Target?
    * Specific optimisations for certain graph types.
  * Edit:
    * Worked on driver Function.
    * Researched into different variations of the game.
    * Planned the implementation of all required functions.

* **Week 12 [PROJECT WEEK]** Status report submitted.
  * Continue work from Week 11
  * Complete Status report
  * Edit:
    * Converted Tower/Targets to use Classes.
    * Completion of the main driver script.

* **Winter break**
  * Added additional tests to test suite.
  * Bug fixes for calculating Optimal Target Path

## Spring Semester

* **Week 13**
  * Complete outstanding work from Semester 1
  * Begin Dissertation
  * Edit:
    * Completion of Heuristic Target next move function.
    * Additional bug fixes for calculating Optimal Target Path
    * Added Unit-tests for Heuristic function

* **Week 14**
  * Dissertation work
  * Edit:
    * Completion of Unittests
    * Completion of main.py driver function
    * Implementation of Clock Time evaluation
* **Week 15**
  * First Draft of Dissertation completed
* **Week 16**
  * Refine dissertation
* **Week 17**
  * Second draft dissertation
* **Week 19**
  * Dissertation Work
* **Week 20**
  * Dissertation Work
* **Week 21**
