* Tracking on a Graph
* Patrick Justin Devanney

* Dr. Jessica Enright

Week-by-week plan for the whole project. Update this as you go along.

## Winter semester

* **Week 1 -- Complete (All Targets Met)**
  * Rank Project Proposals
* **Week 2 -- Complete (All Target Met)**
  * Meet supervisor for initial meeting
  * Initial Research, Develop Ideas
  * Set up Technology -- PyCharm, NetworkX, Anaconda, GitHub
  * Have programming at basic stage
    * Create Random Graph
    * Populates with set number of Towers at random vertices
    * Populates a Target at a Random vertex
      * Map Distance to Target from Graph
    * Display Graph
* **Week 3**
  * Refine Ideas with Supervisor
  * Do Additional Research as Required
  * Improve current codebase
  * Implement Turn feature (random or choosen moves by Target)
  * Begin to implement optimisations for Tower
* **Week 4**
  * Research additional optimisations that could be made
    * Gather evidence on why they will improve the code
  * Continue with optimisations
    * For Tower and Target
  * Edit:
    * Begin to implement Testing	

* **Week 5**
  * Once optimisations are completed, begin to assess different Aspects
    * Effect of Optimisations on different graphs
    * Are optimisations valid?
      * Non-optimised vs Optimised
* **Week 6**
  * Begin research into other Graph Types?
  * Start to complete an evaluation of the program on different settings - Number of Towers. Size of Graph, others...
* **Week 7**
  * Continue evaluation into different settings. 
* **Week 8**
  * With this knowledge look into improving the current codebase
* **Week 9**
  * Continue to refine codebase and operations
* **Week 10**
  * Begin to look into additional Graph Types that could be evaluated
* **Week 11 [PROJECT WEEK]**
  * Evaluation of different Graph types.
    * Easiest / Hardest to Locate Target
    * Can you always locate the Target?
    * Specific optimisations for certain graph types.
* **Week 12 [PROJECT WEEK]** Status report submitted.
  * Continue work from Week 11
  * Complete Status report
